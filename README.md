Design for a virtual pet simulator using UML diagrams
# Virtual Pet Simulator
It simulates the experience of taking care of a virtual pet, providing users with a realistic and enjoyable gameplay experience.

## Project Overview
The design for this project aims to give a basis for the whole Simulator, and the diagrams for when implementing later. 

### Why are these diagrams important?
Before designing these diagrams, it's crucial to collect and analyze project requirements. These diagrams serve as visual representations of the system's architecture, behavior, and interactions, guiding the development process. After designing the diagrams, the implementation phase begins, translating the design into actual code. In summary, the diagrams bridge the gap between requirements analysis and implementation, facilitating communication and guiding the development team.

## Diagrams

- [**Class Diagram**](#[class-diagram](https://app.genmymodel.com/api/projects/_LQYv4OlbEe6YcvViuOreEw/diagrams/_LQYv4-lbEe6YcvViuOreEw/svg)):  Represents the structure of the virtual pet simulator, including supported pet types and their interactions.
- **Sequence Diagram:** Illustrates the flow of interactions between the user, the UI, and the pet module.
- **State Machine Diagram:** Models the states and transitions of the virtual pet, such as hunger, thirst, happiness, and sickness.
- **Activity Diagram:** Visualizes the workflow of caring for the virtual pet, including feeding, grooming, and playing.
- **Use Case Diagram:** Identifies the different actors and use cases in the system, such as feeding, playing, and monitoring the pet's health.
